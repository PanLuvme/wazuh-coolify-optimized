A custom, resource-efficient implementation of the **Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system, specifically engineered for self-hosted environments like **Coolify** and **Docker**.

## 🏗️ Architecture
This stack deploys the three core Wazuh components:
1.  **Wazuh Indexer:** The highly scalable search and analytics engine (OpenSearch derivative).
2.  **Wazuh Server (Manager):** The analysis engine that processes agent data.
3.  **Wazuh Dashboard:** The web user interface for data visualization and threat hunting.
